# Notey

Notes app for simple daily note taking on Windows, built using the WinUI3 UI framework.

### Getting Started

Once the app is running, you can select a date using the calendar to create a note for that day. Close the tab to save the file.

If you want to create a template for new notes:
- click on edit template
- add template text
- create a new note

### Installing

Once I make a download for it instructions will appear here:

Otherwise if you want to download, just clone the repository and run it in Visual Studio, follow [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/set-up-your-development-environment?tabs=cs-vs-community%2Ccpp-vs-community%2Cvs-2022-17-1-a%2Cvs-2022-17-1-b) for what tools must be installed to run a WinUI3 project.

### Bugs

- Creating a note, editing it and then immediately closing it without switching to another tab in the app crashes it.

### Planned Features

- Search function for searching through all your notes to find infomation.
- Settings panel to adjust UI.
- Cleaner UI with suitable colours.
